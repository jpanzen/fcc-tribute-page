            <h2 id="life">Life</h2>
            <p class="content-paragraph">Frida Kahlo was born on July 6, 1907, in Coyoac√°n, a suburb of Mexico City. At the age of six, she contracted polio, which caused her right leg to become shorter and thinner than the left. This childhood illness left her with a lifelong limp. Then, at the age of 18, Kahlo was involved in a bus accident that left her with severe injuries, including a broken spinal column, collarbone, ribs, and pelvis. During her recovery, she began to paint, using a special easel that allowed her to work from her bed. Her art became not only a form of expression but also a way to cope with her physical and emotional pain.</p>
            <h2 id="death">Death</h2>
            <p class="content-paragraph">Frida Kahlo passed away on July 13, 1954, at the age of 47. Her health had been declining for several years, and she had undergone numerous surgeries and medical treatments. The official cause of death was reported as a pulmonary embolism, but there are theories and speculations that suggest she may have died by suicide.</p>
            <h2 id="art">Art</h2>
            <p class="content-paragraph">Kahlo's art is characterized by its deeply personal and introspective nature. She often painted self-portraits that captured her physical and emotional struggles, including her experiences with chronic pain, infertility, and identity. One of her most famous works, "The Two Fridas," depicts her dual heritage and the emotional turmoil she experienced during her divorce from Diego Rivera. Kahlo's paintings are filled with symbolism drawn from Mexican culture, including indigenous motifs, religious iconography, and references to pre-Columbian art. Her bold use of color and intricate detail have made her work instantly recognizable and deeply impactful.</p>
            <h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>
            <p class="content-paragraph">Frida Kahlo's influence extends far beyond the realm of art. She is celebrated not only for her technical skill and innovation but also for her unapologetic embrace of her own identity and experiences. Kahlo's art has inspired generations of artists, feminists, and activists around the world. Her willingness to confront taboo subjects such as female sexuality, miscarriage, and disability has paved the way for greater acceptance and understanding of these issues in society. Today, Kahlo's legacy continues to resonate, and her work remains a powerful testament to the strength and resilience of the human spirit.</p>
